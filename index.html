       <p>It all started in 2007, when I had my first sip of LaCroix&reg;. (If somehow you don't know, LaCroix&reg; is a sparkling water beverage.) I was hanging out with my good friend Ryan, in our first summer together after going off to different colleges the year before, and he had invited me to take a drink from his fridge. What you need to know about Ryan is that his house is a mansion in one of the nicest neighborhoods in the city.</p>

        <p>So I see this cold aluminum can sitting in the door of this lavish kitchen, with a French name like LaCroix, in a huge house in a fancy neighborhood, so I assume that this is an imported delicacy.</p>

        <p>When the first rush of bubbles hit my tongue and throat, it was a revelation. The flavor was "Pamplemousse", which is just the French word for "grapefruit". My life changed forever in that moment.</p>

        <p>Knowing what I know now, would I stop myself from taking that first sip? Would I slap the can out of my quivering hand before it touched my lips? How many thousands of dollars have I given the National Beverage Corporation&reg;? How many lives have I ruined with my thirst? Is there any way I can atone for the things I've done?</p>

        <p>Come with me, now, and I will tell you of the things I've done, and of my plan for vengeance.

        <p>At the start, it was only a can or two a week, on special occasions. Then it became a habit, and I always had an open container beside me, whether I was at home, at work, or even driving.</p>

        <p>It was a non-stop party. The ripped packaging of LaCroix&reg; cases littered the floor of my apartment. I told myself that is was healthy, that it was okay, because I was using it as a substitute for soda pop.</p>

        <p>Tap water started tasting like pond scum. I could barely swallow liquids that were flat and boring. I didn't want to drink anything unless it had that bite. I lived for that burning sensation as you chug that makes you release a primal "Ahhh" as you come up for air.</p>

        <img src="images\0004_Tangerine-Dragon-Scream.jpg">

        <p>My friends started to joke about it, noticing that I always had a can in my hand. My girlfriend would ask me if I'd like to have glass of water. The implication, the unspoken accusation was on the tip of her tongue. I just stared at her as I walked to the fridge and cracked another one.</p>

        <p>When I noticed how quickly the cost was adding up, I experimented with other brands of sparkling beverages. Sometimes I wouldn't notice the artifical sweetener, and when the aspartame hit my mouth it was like drinking a gym sock. Crystal Ice&reg; is unfit for human consumption. I strayed, but I always came back to LaCroix&reg; to get another fix.

        <p>At this point, it was 2014 and the LaCroix fad was past its peak. But I couldn't let go the way others could. I was tied to the tracks, and the train of life was heading right for me.</p>

        <p>I'd wake up and have one before breakfast. I'd make sure to leave one on the nightstand so the soft plinking and popping of the carbonation would lull me to sleep. I'd sneak out to my car at work to throw back a few more.</p>

        <img src="images\0000s_0008_Puttin-on-the-Glitz-1.jpg">

        <p>I realized I had a problem when I started drinking it flat and warm. I'd have three or four open cans at once and it didn't matter how old they were. I'd have an open one that had been sitting out in the car. Hot, flat, lemon water tastes like weak tea but it was good enough for me. I lost all pretense of dignity and decorum. I was addicted, and I needed help.</p>

        <p>My friends were there for me. I sobered up and got it under control. But it would only last for a short time. I'd always go back for another can.</p>

        <p>I must confess, there's one sitting on my desk at this very moment, staring at me as I write these words. Will I ever be able to escape?

        <body>
            <p>I fantasize about taking down the whole industry. Those fat cats who are getting filthy rich off the thirst of the peasants. What do they care how many lives they destroy?</p>
    
            <p>So how do you destoy a self-perpetuating machine? You take away its food, its prey.</p>
    
            <p>If just half of people drinking sparkling water switched back to soda, the whole empire would come crashing down. There are so many off-brands and the market is so competitive, even a small downturn would send the industry into a spiral that would take decades to recover from.</p>
    
            <p>Are you with me? Will you share a Coke&reg; with me to take down this demon?</p>
